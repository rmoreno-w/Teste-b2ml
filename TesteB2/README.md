 # TesteB2
 
 Hey there!

My name is Rodrigo Moreno and I tried to build this project in order for a test that required me to build a table disposing info about the star wars movies, using the Star Wars API (link: http://swapi.dev/api). I hadn't had contact with Angular before and took me a while to get the inital basics of it, there may be some mistakes and I may have not applied the best practices, but hey, it's a try!

The project consists on a Web Application that displays a table containing basic info about the 6 first movies, consuming data from the Star Wars API. It should also return characters, planets, species and starships that show up in each movie when you click a button, but I could not implement those in time (currently it only shows up a modal when the button is clicked).

To run the project, you need to install Angular CLI and Bootstrap.

When it is done, you just got to open the application directory in prompt or git bash and type it the commands:

>>**-npm install**

>>**-ng serve**



This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
